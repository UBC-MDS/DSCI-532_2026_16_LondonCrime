## For Users

The *Crime in London* dashboard centralises publicly available crime data for London into one interactive tool. It is designed for:

- **Government and public safety staff** who need quick, high-level summaries of crime levels across boroughs and over time.
- **Prospective residents and relocators** deciding which boroughs to live in based on crime levels and trends.
- **Tourists and visitors** who want to understand which areas are safer for staying or going out at night.
- **Legal and policy professionals** who need evidence-based crime statistics to support or challenge claims in specific boroughs.

**What the dashboard helps you do**

- **Understand overall crime levels** via total crimes and crime rate per 1,000 people.
- **Compare boroughs** to see which are relatively safer or higher risk.
- **Explore patterns over time** (e.g., whether crime is rising or falling in a given area).
- **Drill into crime types** (e.g., theft, robbery, violence) to see which offences dominate where.

This enables better-informed decisions, such as choosing a neighbourhood to move to, selecting a hotel, or supporting arguments in reports and legal cases.
